Fan Speed Automation Control
In this project, a temperature sensor is used to detect the current
temperature and the speed of the fan is controlled accordingly.# Domotic-House
An Indo-Spanish multicultural collaborative project on Home Automation Systems using Arduino

We entered into collaboration with the students of URJC, Madrid (Rey Juan Carlos University) to help them build a domotic
house project wherein functions of the house are automated for the convenience as well as for safety of the home-owners.

We have included in the project, simulations produced on Autodesk Tinkercad using Arduino and many other electrical components. 
The final project was created after Phases 1 /2/ 3 of collaboration on basic circuits to get us familiarized with the 
concepts of the simulator as well as the electronics used.

The final project includes five functional parts that can be used independently of each other and implemented in homes all
around the world to reap its benefits. The parts are listed below along with a brief description of their working:

1. Smart Lighting system: 

In this project, we will show you how to switch a light on or off depending on
exterior light levels, with an Arduino board and some components. This will be
achieved by using a photocell sensor, which is a basically a light-dependent resistor.

2. Gas Sensor Arduino Shield

In this project, we show how to light different LEDs according to level of
gas. In case of high level of gas, all the LEDs light up indicating a
possible fire/gas leak in the house.

3. Temperature Sensor

In this project, a temperature rise above 45 degree celcius is detected by
means of a temperature sensor and indicated by a buzzer.

4. Fan Speed Automation Control

In this project, a temperature sensor is used to detect the current
temperature and the speed of the fan is controlled accordingly.

5. Anti-Theft Alarm

This is a circuit that use the PIR or Passive Infrared Sensor to detect
motion. Whenever motion is detected an alarm ( a series of musical
notes ) is played by the circuit.

We encourage the user to make changes and add to the existing simulations in Tinkercad.
This will bring new ideas for the project which is our aim exactly.

Thank You
